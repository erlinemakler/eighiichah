What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. Programming, use VS Code mostly for web development. Also quite a bit of live sports streaming. What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? ~ 750 USD When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy. Within the next couple weeks. Больше, чем обычные технологии. Больше, чем бизнес.

PC Background: Built My PC \~2 years ago, and have had an unfair number of issues with it in the past - all of which i have learnt how to fix, except, of course, for the newest edition of Ben's PC screwing up: Rewind to \~4/5 months ago: just using my computer, when i go out of my room for around 5 minutes. By the time i get back, my computer has restarted and is not giving an image through display (2). I go into OpenHardwareMonitor and my graphics card is no longer recognised. &#x200B. Hey all, just grabbed my first CRT and I'm itching to get my PC hooked up to this thing. Unfortunately from the research I've done there are only cheap HDMI to component transcoders/scalers available that scale down to a minimum of 480i and introduce noticeable latency, which is not what I'm looking for. The end goal for this project is to be able to display RetroArch at 240p 15khz from my Linux PC to my consumer CRT (Toshiba 27AF45C) which has been modded to support RGB SCART. I plan on making. Over the last couple many years,we have found the netbook occur and go,and we have viewed the rise with the iPad,Android tablets and Google's ChromeBooks.The market for Windows-based items is declining.ChromeBooks are performing the most hurt into the sales of affordable Home windows based PCs while in the west.Microsoft inside the final 12 months has designed several amends to its Windows business model and it has been in damage control manner.Asus,the corporation that started out the netbook. Good! I have a problem with the compatibility of a graphics card with an Intel-based PC. First of all, the graphics card: \- It's a " Sapphire Radeon HD 6870 ". As you know, these graphics cards are built with AMD technology . It was reviewed by a trained technician, then look at it and test it on your personal computer (with components very similar to mine) and if you give it an image, it gave me the conclusion that the graphic card is not compatible with my computer Trying to connect Dell monitor 1907FPt to Toshiba Satellite E45t B4106 and cannot get any picture to display. I have tried a VGA to HDMI and DVI-D to HDMI. The computer recognizes the monitor is plugged in, however nothing will display on the screen. I have updated the drivers, tried all the basic extend/duplicate options, but no picture will come up on the monitor. 
# Hi there, I'd appreciate some help. EDIT - 12/22/2018: I'm considering this a closed thread while I try to back up my data and reinstall Windows. If the problem persists, I'll reopen the topic. My laptop, when I got it, ran perfectly fine. My only gripes were that it didn't come with Bluetooth support and it only has 500GB of storage (or so they say). In the beginning, I downloaded too many games from Steam, and used lots of big software (ie. 3DS Max, Unity, trials of FL Studio Hey, i Hope I am right here to ask this, I am using Linux on my Laptop and the screen tearing bugs me. In the "additional drivers" I don't find any drivers. is there any way to fix it? my specs: SYSTEM INFORMATION Running Ubuntu Linux, the Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) release. GNOME: 3.28.2 (Ubuntu) Kernel version: 4.15.0-42-generic (#45-Ubuntu SMP Thu Nov 15 19:32:57 UTC 2018) GCC: no gcc detected Xorg: 1.19.6 (25 October 2018 04:11:27PM). I have i5-8400 cpu, msi gaming plus z370 motherboard, gigabyte g1 gtx 1080, 16gb corsair lpx ram, corsair tx550m psu, 240gb corsair force le200 ssd, 500gb toshiba hdd, 5 sp120 fans with fan hub and rgb controller. I built my 2nd pc yesterday and it went pretty well and i’ve updated everything drivers etc. i’ve played several games with my friends whole night and there was no problem whatsoever. Everything was perfect. But after i woke up this morning, i realized that front sata 3.1 cable. For the past month or so my PC has been freezing up. I built this computer myself last year and never used any anti-virus software on it, so I naturally assumed that there could have been some malware. So, I did a clean reset of windows and went to reinstalled it. This took about a weekend as each time I would go to re-install windows it would freeze up while installing windows. So, it seemed to me that it had something to do with my GPU as in the mornings it would go longer without freezi. So I tried doing a clean nvidia geforce driver install and after my PC rebooted i got an error message reading along the lines of "Error: VGA.dll missing, (something something) can not continue". Now, I don't know what causes this. I remember trying to install the CD drivers I recieved with my GPU (Gtx 1070 strix OC) but it froze at x% and I had to reboot my pc. What can I do? Sometimes certain games like Arma 3, SCUM, Fortnite, PUBG will just randomly crash after 5 minutes. I did a full reboot. I'm currently using Toshiba Qosmio laptop with Intel 3rd gen i7 proc and GTX 670M. Used Win10 and Ubuntu 18.04 afterwards. My drivers were up to date, but the only thing I changed was my primary GPU to GTX because after every Win Update, it would set the integrated back to primary. I was playing WoW and it just crashed, gave me the "3D Accelerator not supported" error after almost three years. I googled the error, reinstalled drivers, set the primary GPU and did whatever people on forums advis. 
I've tried almost every solution i could find on the internet. About a month ago, i installed a 6GB GTX 1060 SSC GPU. I use an HDMI cable for my main monitor and a DVI for my secondary monitor. When I installed the new driver, i turned my computer on and everything installed correctly. The one thing that changed was that i didnt have any audio, even though my headset was plugged in to my front jack along with my microphone cable. I tried plugging three different speakers and other headphones. A few weeks ago I posted here a wee post about the 10 old Toshiba c660 that I will be putting into a school as a test of the viability of placing eOS in some of our Carmarthenshire primary schools. Here in Wales, we have a centralized education platform called Hwb so these days all that is really needed is something that runs a browser to get the pupils out to Hwb. We have some schools that have an aging estate of Macs that are generally in good condition , other than the software being So I tried doing a clean nvidia geforce driver install and after my PC rebooted i got an error message reading along the lines of "Error: VGA.dll missing, (something something) can not continue". Now, I don't know what causes this. I remember trying to install the CD drivers I recieved with my GPU (Gtx 1070 strix OC) but during what I assume was middag installation my screen turned gray and I had to reboot my pc. What can I do?
