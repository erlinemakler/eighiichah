                            <p>Figure 239: Foundations of the Earth. On Day 2 of the creation week, the raqia (a Hebrew word sometimes translated “expanse” or “firmament”) was placed in the midst of the waters that covered the Earth. 2 As explained on page 541, raqia means a pressed-out or pressing-out solid. Europa's trailing hemisphere in approximate natural color. The prominent crater in the lower right is Pwyll and the darker regions are areas where Europa's primarily water ice surface has a higher mineral content. Boden cantered into the small town of Broadleaf astride a majestic chestnut courser, but though his steed looked proud, the man riding it did not. Like all members of his order he wore brightly polished and gilded armor, but beneath that armor was a man that could as easily be mistaken for a highwayman as a law-man. His short-cropped copper hair was a greasy mess, his clothes were disheveled and he sported the tangled beard of someone who had not bothered with hygiene in many days. Although. Study Design. This double-blind, double-dummy, factorial randomized trial (the Second MIST trial MIST2 ) was conducted at 11 centers in the United Kingdom from December 2005 to November. 
I’m probably going to die on this island, and I don’t blame anyone for that except Peter Hammond. Peter was the kind of guy who probably would’ve been chief of his village a few thousand years ago. Not the wise elder, casting bones onto the fire kind of chief, mind you. He would’ve been the kind of chief who proved himself by felling a mammoth with his bare hands and then wearing its fur as a cloak. Unfortunately for Peter and, I guess, even more unfortunately for me, he missed that phase.

Several things have happened in the past two days that change the situation. Bear with me, it’s a lot to explain. There’s a good reason I haven’t been focused on writing this up anymore. First, thank you to everyone who respo. Glyphosate is an aminophosphonic analogue of the natural amino acid glycine, and like all amino acids, exists in different ionic states depending on pH.Both the phosphonic acid and carboxylic acid moieties can be ionised and the amine group can be protonated and the substance exists as a series of zwitterions. Okay, so I'm going to preface this: I personally believe we are not chaotic evil for saying this. However, I am also the type of person who can feel that a bias sits so firmly within a person that it could skew their perception without their notice, even if they attempt to be unbiased. I will do my best to pose this in such a way that it is without bias. However, this is ultimately my perspective on the matter, so take it as you will. It's also a year's worth of crap. I apologize for this being.  During the winter, especially, humidity levels drop because cold air holds less moisture than warm air. Homes that utilize forced air heating have an exacerbated problem because furnaces use combustion to create hot air, thus burning out most of the water vapor that existed in the first place. Hello, Reddit. As you can probably tell if you look at my post history, I don’t post much here on the front page of the internet. Today, I’m going to make an exception to that. The campaign that kickstarted my interest in tabletop RPGs ended some six months ago. In those six months, I’ve wanted to share the complete story somewhere. It was a wild ride of horror stories from beginning to end. 4chan, my usual stomping ground, isn’t really good for a story this long, and I want it to achieve

I got heavily sidetracked while reading up on the Ranger subclass Beast Master, when I realized that you technically could have a Swarm of Bats as your companion, which led me to toying with the idea of making a PC inspired by Dracula. I'm basing it off the version from Bram Stoker's novel, which would give him the following: Powers, from the book : 1. ~~Can travel to "unhallowed" ground (i.e. graves of suicides and his victims)~~ \- Too specific, couldn't solve this one 2. ~~"No shadow.

So Anduin's finally here, meaning I get to crawl out of my procrastination pit to make another lore thread. I'd love to write a longer intro if it wasn't for the fact that this is already a very long post. I'm sorry. There's a lot of Anduin to talk about. I can write a TL;DR in the comments if requested.

There was an excitement in the air, electric but vibrant even though most knew that at the end of the death-match _Several minutes earlier._ Lucifer, the Emperor of Providence, darts back and forth as she tries to evade Gabriel's concentrated holy energy blasts. The Archangel of Power fires dozens of bolts from both palms, narrowly missing the agile Emperor as she dodges from left to right. "Hold still. Thou art only delaying the inevitable." His voice, calm as a lake on a summer day, betrays no emotion. However, he narrows his eyes and glares at her with a slight hint of bubbling rage. "Thou What does everyone think of Jaime’s dream in the crypt of winterfell now?He references a dead Ned Stark and Brienne as a knight! He had the dream at the stump of a weirwood tree. Maybe a green dream? Text below: “Naked and alone he stood, surrounded by enemies, with stone walls all around him pressing close. The Rock, he knew.

He held his right hand up and flexed his fingers to feel the strength THE MOUNTAINS OF WEHO PRESEASON The twinkling nightscape of West Hollywood bled into the rugged southern Californian foothills. The steep, rocky terrain reached upwards, eventually disappearing into the murky blanket of smog and pollution that hung over the city. As the incline grew harsher and the altitude grew higher, pebbles and dirt morphed into a thin layer of fresh, powdery snow, crunching underfoot.

“You must be mistaken,” Raul deflected, “I only see the dead and strange— I don’t have any latent powers!” The rain had stopped pitter-pattering on the wall-sized window, thunder rolled at irregular intervals, travelling away from them. Raul felt dizzy, of course he knew that he was not like other people, but a Weaver? He just found out they existed altogether! He wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do with this information. The Gray Weaver gave Raul a quizzical look, “You’ve never tried reach. ".This was unexpected. Such behaviour.” Tokinada groaned. Aura answered casually. “Oh? This was unexpected? You’re the one who says that you trust no one, Tokinada-sama.” Aura bore no particular hatred towards Tokinada. She did not really want to kill him either. She would be satisfied with just stopping him. However, since it was impossible to stop Tokinada without killing him; Aura was prepared to move in for the kill, in order to save Hikone. Therefore, she was also prepared Before I forget, I'd like to thank UncleKrees and BimboBear for the amazing art for chapter 4.

Uriel gasps in shock as her beloved brother, a man she's known for eons, thrusts his hand forward and plunges it into her chest. Michael jabs his knife-like fingers through her ribs with one hand and grabs her by the throat with the other. Too late, Uriel realizes. Crystal’s attack had been in vain, but would not come without a cost. Many of the camp’s structures, including several cabins had been badly damaged if not destroyed by the barrage of cannonballs. A few campers had gone down in the battle, and several more were recovering from injuries. If that wasn’t bad enough, the questers still had not returned. Camp was still at risk for the next waive of monster attacks, and with the number of campers dwindling, hope was beginning to fade. From the shado. Since we've had our seventh visit to the Queen's Court it feels as good a time any to post this. I initially posted it on r/DestinyLore in November and have been keeping it updated since then but I'd imagine not many people from this sub haven't seen it. It's admittedly a bit messy, but I wasn't really originally intending to post it anywhere publically. Initially I had personally kept some transcripts for the missions because I knew it'd be quite awkward to find it later on - a lot of Youtube. Recently my players came across a Book of Vile Darkness in my campaign. Like any inquisitive party, they really wanted to know more of what was inside of the book. So after a few days of going over past publications and pulling some inspiration from some of my favorite fantasy tales, I have put together the following supplement for one of the most iconic evil artifacts in DampD. It includes forbidden curses, a path to lichdom, fiendish truenames, a couple pages of evil spells ported First Post (https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/a8ozu7/so_i_guess_im_the_paladm_now/) Previous Post (https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/b1fp4v/paladins_order_undivided_part_46_enough_rope_to/) gtBe Me, PalaDM, Lord of conveniently well-hidden planar crossings and references to other more popular pieces of media. gtBe Kazador the Salamander, Yndri the Raven Guard, Peregrin the Phoenix, Senket the Fist, Jort of the Purged, and Julian the Black, Paladins of Order. 
# Intro When it comes to Targaryen history, I believe it's fair to say that it often seems as if something is going on just beneath surface. The Tragedy of Summerhall and Rhaegar's birth, the Great Spring Sickness and Bloodraven's massive funeral pyre, the Battle Above the Gods Eye and Aemond's sapphire eye, much of Maegor's reign, etc. If I'm not mistaken, the prevalent opinion in the community appears to be that moments such as these likely have no greater significance; they're not evidenc. This is based off of a combination of linus's vid on bong cooling with shower heads and tall pvc pipes (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsQKyAswAPI (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsQKyAswAPI)) and how actual cooling towers work. Cooling towers are used on everything from power plants (those big hourglass shaped cooling towers on nuclear reactors are an example of them. and they are used on a smaller scale on large office buildings. Also as a bonus, this will be my final project I have created the most in-depth and detailed Fortnite: Battle Royale theory on the web. Enjoy! Please keep in mind comments refer to the MUCH longer theory here before. I'm rewriting it all in the next few days so please be patient and check in frequently until it's once again done. Thanks! There are two celestial gods. Ark is good, and Malcore is evil. Ark and Malcore belong to the eternal struggle set, and this is exactly what they are: An Eternal Struggle.
