I thought I caught a hint of genuine empathy glitter behind her eyes as she turned away, or maybe it was just pity. amp#x200B; ‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù I asked, my stomach lurching.

Buckle up, this is a long one. I did a bunch of research on the Seven Heavens and I found some‚Ä¶ interesting things. Especially considering an interview (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/the-oa-behind-the-scenes-of-netflixs-mysterious-new-hit-series-122824/amp/) I read where Zal said that Khatun's realm is a very specific thing. 
Hana is a bright young girl who lost her father at a young age. When her mother returns to Japan, she comes with her new Korean husband and his son Yunsuh. Yunsuh's mother died during his 10th birthday and after her death, he becomes autistic. While Hana is fond of her new step-brother I have told you many times over the years about a ‚Äúsmall boy‚Äù. I mention it so much because that nameless boy grows up to become Brandon the Builder. I have also theorized for years that Bran Stark is in fact Brandon the Builder. He goes back in time physically; most likely to escape certain death at the hands of the Night King. He is considered a small boy because in the book series only, a few years have passed to get to the point they find themselves in now that we are in the final TV episode. Hana is a bright young girl who lost her father at a young age. When her mother returns to Japan, she comes with her new Korean husband and his son Yunsuh. His name was Billy, and he was 15. I was 13. At that age, you feel like you‚Äôre worlds apart, and for me that was exhilarating. He was in high school ! I felt like the coolest girl in school. We got to second base-- er, I should say, middle-school second base. Or rather, my middle-school second base. I went to a private school, very conservative. First base was smiling at each other, second base was holding hands. I know it sounds silly, right? The diamond would need to have like 20 bases.
